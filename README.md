## Personal Learning and Experience

Boomtown was the first project I have done, as a part of the RED Academy Application Developer program. Also my first experience in developing back-end side of a web application. Through this project I have learned a great deal about databases, http requests and how servers hadle them. It was also my first time using React.js for front-end development. Overall this project was a great experience and I believe these tools will contribute greatly to my full-stack development skills.
